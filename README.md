# Grocery Calculator
_Coding exercise for Maxwell by [Jeremy Weathers](mailto:j_l_w@me.com)_

## Setup

1. For best results, make sure you have Ruby **2.7.1** installed (or double-check `.ruby-version`).
2. Install the dependencies:
    - `bundle install --path vendor/bundle`
3. _Run the test suite to make sure it doesn't only work on my machine (optional):_
    - `bundle exec rspec`
4. Run the CLI program and calculate your purchase:
    - `./grocery-calculator.rb`
